Great‚Äîthis is a solid foundation for a white paper. Here's a suggested structure tailored to your focus:

---

### üìÑ **White Paper Title**  
**‚ÄúPerformance Dynamics of Containerized Applications under Load Balancing with Remote Service Dependencies‚Äù**

---

### 1. **Executive Summary**
- Briefly introduce the problem: evaluating containerized deployments under load balancing.
- Summarize key insights from performance comparison with traditional (non-containerized) deployments.
- Highlight impact of delayed responses from remote services on one container and system-wide implications.

---

### 2. **Introduction**
- Context: Rise of containerization and load balancing in modern architectures.
- Objective of the study.
- Importance of understanding performance behaviors under real-world scenarios.

---

### 3. **Background & Related Work**
- Overview of traditional deployments vs. containerized architectures.
- Role of load balancers (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy).
- Cite similar published work or white papers (you can reference AWS, Keyhole, etc.).

---

### 4. **Test Environment & Methodology**
- System setup:
  - 3 containers behind a load balancer.
  - One container with intentional delayed response due to remote service.
- Tools used: Docker, Nginx (or other LB), Gatling/JMeter, etc.
- Metrics measured: response time, throughput, failure rate, CPU/memory usage.

---

### 5. **Factors Affecting Performance**
- Containerization overhead (network, CPU, memory).
- Resource contention.
- I/O bottlenecks vs. bare-metal or standalone deployments.
- Orchestration/tooling impact (e.g., Docker networking, overlay networks).

---

### 6. **Analysis: Load Balancer with Delayed Container**
- Behavioral analysis when one container has delayed responses.
- How the LB handles it (round-robin/failover/etc.).
- Impact on overall performance, user experience, and error propagation.
- Compare this with theoretical ideal behavior.

---

### 7. **Results & Observations**
- Charts, graphs, tables comparing:
  - Regular vs. containerized
  - With and without delayed container
- Highlight throughput drops, increase in latencies or failures.

---

### 8. **Recommendations**
- Improve resilience: retries, circuit breakers, smarter LB algorithms.
- Design for graceful degradation.
- Isolate containers affected by delays using health checks.

---

### 9. **Conclusion**
- Reaffirm main findings.
- Emphasize the need for intelligent load balancing and performance-aware container orchestration.

---

### 10. **Appendices (Optional)**
- Test scripts (Gatling, shell scripts).
- Nginx/Docker configs.
- Detailed hardware specs.
