Iperf tool for checking network related latency
This open-source tool is indispensable for measuring network performance in IP-based computer networks. 
iPerf excels in conducting essential assessments, including bandwidth testing, latency, packet loss, and more.
iPerf designates one device as the server, which actively listens for connections, operating on a client-server model. 
Another device initialize the connections, working as the client, to perform thorough performance tests.
